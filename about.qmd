# About this blog

## Introduction

Hello!
My name is Suvaditya Mukherjee. I am a student of the Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence Program at NMIMS MPSTME, Mumbai.

I have played around and dabbled in many different disciplines of Computer Science in a quest to find out what excites me the most, and I have realized that Deep Learning and its applications in solving Real-world problems is the best way I see myself utilizing my skills for bettering the community.

I am a former Lead of the Google Developer Student Club at NMIMS MPSTME Mumbai and the former Co-Head of the Technical Software department at the International Society of Automation, NMIMS MPSTME Mumbai.

I have formerly interned for 2 months at Mosaic Wellness Pvt. Ltd. as a Software Engineer Intern

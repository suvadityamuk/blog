## Introduction

Hello!
My name is Suvaditya Mukherjee. I am a student of the Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence Program at NMIMS MPSTME, Mumbai.

I have played around and dabbled in many different disciplines of Computer Science in a quest to find out what excites me the most, and I have realized that Deep Learning and its applications in solving Real-world problems is the best way I see myself utilizing my skills for bettering the community.

I am a **Google Summer of Code Mentor, Org Admin and a ML Research Engineer Intern at [Ivy (lets-unify.ai)](https://lets-unify.ai)**, former Lead of the [Google Developer Student Club](https://www.gdscmpstme.com/) at NMIMS MPSTME Mumbai and the former Co-Head of the Technical Software department at the [International Society of Automation](http://www.isampstme.com/), NMIMS MPSTME Mumbai. I have formerly interned for 2 months at [Mosaic Wellness Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.mosaicwellness.in/) as a Software Engineer Intern as well.

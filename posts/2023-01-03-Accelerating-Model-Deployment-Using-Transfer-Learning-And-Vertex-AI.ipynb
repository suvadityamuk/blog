    "### Step 1: What are keras.applications and Hugging Face?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained models are specific Deep-Learning models that have been trained on a certain dataset of a given task and are available freely on the internet. These models have weights for the network hosted in a way that they can be retrieved. If the user requires, they can also fine-tune the weights by initializing the model and training, using the pre-trained model as a starting point compared to using Random initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of taking pre-trained models and fine-tuning them or using them on a different task than the one they were originally trained for, is known as Transfer Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "But where do you find these models?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TensorFlow-Keras ecosystem**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/tf-vertex-ai/tensorflow_logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most mature ecosystems for pre-trained models is available using the keras.applications Module or using [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/).\n",
    "[`keras.applications`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications) contains a total of 38 Vision models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset by the team behind Keras. They also provide a table that details statistics like the number of parameters within the model as well as benchmarks like inference latency on a general configuration. These models are extensively used and are available free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this, you don’t need to just get inferences. You can get everything in between, be it feature-vectors or fine-tuned models, or even just the base model that can perform inference for ImageNet classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it seems suitable to your use case, you can even convert these models to [TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) and deploy them to edge devices (provided the number of parameters is under a certain threshold to ensure support).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Keras keeps on adding support for newer models, you can also check out the supplementary packages of [KerasCV](https://keras.io/keras_cv/) and [KerasNLP](https://keras.io/keras_nlp/). They contain a larger set of more exotic models along with their pre-trained weights. [(You can even try out the latest Stable Diffusion model directly from KerasCV)](https://keras.io/guides/keras_cv/generate_images_with_stable_diffusion/).\n",
    "If that doesn’t fulfill your needs either, you can turn to community-supported and provided models made available via TensorFlow Hub. Folks from the community make implementations of different models using TensorFlow/Keras, train them and provide them through this centralized Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hugging Face ecosystem**\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/hugging_face.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is easily one of the largest, if not the largest host of models on the internet. With over 100,000 models available, there is a low chance that your use case cannot be fulfilled by a model from here. These models are contributed by the community, small-scale teams, large-scale enterprises, and everything in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprises like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook also release pre-trained weights for their latest models from their research teams here. This gives you access to cutting-edge models in a simple manner and without much overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you get this access for free (while a paid service exists for accessing better compute).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ecosystem also provides support for ancillary tasks around ML, like Accelerate (for training pipeline setups), Diffusers (for working with Diffusion Models), Datasets (for accessing the latest datasets), and Spaces (for hosting your models) along with many more."

    "\n",
    "We push the image to the same URL and upon the building of the image and its subsequent upload, it will be visible on the Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create Vertex AI Model resource\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy our model, we have two steps. First, we must define a Vertex AI Model instance. This is done by importing the container image from Google Artifact Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, first, we set `devfest-mobilenet-imagenet` as the name of our model. We can also provide a small description of the model for documentation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is named, we choose the actual container image from Google Artifact Registry that we are going to use. Circling back to our example, we make use of our previous `devfest-mobilenet-demo` image as the basis of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step3.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your solution is more customized (maybe using something other TF-Serving), you can choose to override the CMD or ENTRYPOINT line of your Dockerfile using the Command field during configuration. Options to set new Environment Variables or Arguments to the process are also present.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step4.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, saving the model will allow you to see it on the Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step5.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Create Vertex AI Endpoint resource\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Vertex AI Model prepared, we now make use of the console to create a Vertex AI Endpoint resource. This endpoint is what will control the full deployment, be it auto-scaling, security, serving, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can click on *‘Create Endpoint`*, which will lead us into the endpoint-creation wizard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line, we give a name to our new Endpoint, followed by setting it up in a specific Region. Here, since our project is setup in `us-central1` , we are going to be restricted to just that. If we have a multi-region project, we can choose other locations too. We also get the option to set up access to the endpoint. If we choose, we can expose the endpoint freely to the internet, or we can make the endpoint private using a VPC network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we connect a Vertex AI Model with the Endpoint by using the model we had defined. We get to choose the version of the model we want to deploy. If we have multiple instances serving the model on the endpoint, we can choose to perform a traffic split. But if it is a single instance, we keep it to a full 100% split.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step7.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of options, we can specify the configuration and the number of compute nodes we would like the model to use. These are backed by GCP Compute Engine and are fully managed. This solution, by its design, auto-scales according to demand and constraints. While a minimum number of compute nodes is set to maintain the availability of the service, we can set a maximum number to control costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An option to set a certain CPU threshold allows us to control when the service will scale up (or down) based on CPU usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step8.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU acceleration is also made available for inference compute, as specified by the Accelerator type. If you have IAM set up within your project and have the permissions policy present in your organization, you can use a Service Account to set what kind of resources the service can requisitions, as an added security check on top of other cost-saving measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step9.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we get options to enable and set up model monitoring, which would include the tracking of several metrics like Drift, Skew, etc. which allow us to understand how our model performs in production settings and what kind of changes are necessary to make sure that it performs as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/step10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us see our deployment in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Perform Testing and Inference\n",
    "First, perform authentication into gcloud SDK on your local machine. Prepare the request in the form of a JSON file that will be sent in the body of the request. Make sure that you include the signature name to use since that becomes an integral part of how the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "[suvaditya@fedora ~]$ gcloud auth application-default login\n",
    "\n",
    "[suvaditya@fedora ~]$ echo {\n",

    "} >> sample_request.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For better readability, add your Vertex AI-provided Endpoint ID and Project ID as environment variables in your shell. Finally, we define a cURL POST request as per the specifications in the code snippet below.\n",

    "## What have we accomplished?\n",
    "By this time, we have completed all our setup. Quite a few things were done within this article. Take a look back at the problems we set out to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/tf-vertex-ai/serving_wrapper.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale**: The solution we made is one that can be used in a production setting. With the capability of Vertex AI and the services for Auto-Scaling and Monitoring, you can leverage state-of-the-art tech to make sure your model is deployed in the most performant way possible.\n",
    "- **Can integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**: Our solution is one that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines due to Google Artifact Registry, which can be as simple as pushing to the registry. You can make use of other GCP Services (or Vertex AI) that will allow you to orchestrate the updates automatically.\n",
    "- **Optimizations**: TF-Serving is inherently performant, allowing you to serve your model without any hassle. Due to its low-latency nature and graph-mode execution, performance is not a thing you need to worry about.\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Each and every one of these components is easily replaceable or can be repaired with relative ease, compared to more rigid or non-debuggable products.\n",
    "- **Tracking**: With state-of-the-art tracking features, your model performance is only a click away. You can leverage automatic insights from Vertex AI as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Where to go from here?**\n",
    "Machine Learning can solve a major number of modern-day problems that startups or any kind of problem-solving body faces. Hence, it becomes an important field to stay on top of. But it is equally important to focus on the deployment aspect since, without it, your service is not available to your customers, leading to no value being added.\n",

### Towards Data Science
- [The Annotated ResNet-50]()
- [How to make your Models available to the public]

### Google Cloud Community - Medium
- [Accelerating Model Deployment using Transfer Learning and Vertex AI]()

### Keras.io
- [Electroencephalogram Signal Classification for action identification](https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/eeg_signal_classification)
- [Using the Forward-Forward Algorithm for Image Classification](https://keras.io/examples/vision/forwardforward/)
- [When Recurrence meets Transformers](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/pull/1279)
